# logos-lalrpop

A small example of how to create a parser using LALRPOP which feeds off of Logos tokens.

Before going through the code, I recommend taking a look at the [Logos documentation](https://docs.rs/logos/0.12.0/logos/) and [LALRPOP book](https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop) to get an idea of how the crates work.
